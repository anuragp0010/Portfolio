    <ul>
        <li>
            <p> Implemented and managed <b>Blue-Green Deployment strategy</b>, ensuring smooth, zero-downtime software releases.
                Oversaw parallel environments, enabling feature deployment in 'Green' while 'Blue' handled production traffic.
                Collaborated cross-functionally to automate deployments, reducing errors. Conducted rigorous testing in 'Green,'
                ensuring seamless user transition. Monitored metrics, collected feedback, and enhanced deployment efficiency.
                Implemented </b>failover mechanisms</b>, ensuring high availability. Documented procedures and provided training for
                effective team deployment.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> As part of the DevOps team, one of the major activities that I have to handle is the maintenance of the <b>Azure
                DevOps application</b>. Our Azure DevOps Server application is installed on an AWS EC2 instance. Recently, I
                managed to get the Azure DevOps application upgraded from the 2020 to 2022 RC 2 version. While doing the
                upgrade we <b>identified some loopholes and planned to initiate DR (Disaster Recovery)</b> for our application. I
                documented the findings and planned for DR activity. Before proceeding with the Production DR activity I made it a
                point to <b>install and establish an alternate QA instance</b> for our Azure DevOps service.

        <li>
            <p> As the clients had a decade-old code base and were using TFVC (Centralized Version Control System). As
                CVCS is no longer used for major development work I suggested the clients migrate their code base from CVCS to
                DVCS. This activity turned out to be a major milestone for the clients as I was tasked to migrate the code base for
                70+ applications from CVCS to DVCS. I played a key role in finalizing the approach of repository migration for
                70+ business applications from a centralized version control system to a distributed version control system (TFVC
                to Azure DevOps GIT). I made sure that the migration included all the branches including their relationship and
                their entire decade-old history. Received a huge recognition and appreciation from the clients for this activity.
            </p>

        <li>
            <p> Collaborated with development and QA teams to establish Git best practices and code review workflows,
                ensuring code quality and faster code integration.

        <li>
            <p> Experience in designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, automating build, test, and
                deployment processes, resulting in a 30% reduction in release cycle time.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> My other tasks included the creation and maintenance of various CI/CD pipelines using YAML. Demonstrating to
                the dev team the possible approach adapted for migrating the repositories and the various advantages of GIT,
                supervising various pipelines, and improving the pipelines by adding various checks to the pipelines like Gitleaks
                scan, SonarQube, CheckMarx, and NexusIQ.
